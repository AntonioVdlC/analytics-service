\`fantomely\` was created out of the need to find a simple, privacy-focused analytics platform for my blog.

After scouting the market for a free (or cheap) solution that would fit my needs, I failed to find something. Some possible tools I looked at include:
- [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) 
- [Plausible](https://plausible.io/)
- [Fugu](https://fugu.lol/)
- [Umami](https://umami.is/)

If you are looking for a serious platform for your analytics needs that also happens to care about your users' privacy, I would recommend checking any of those platforms listed above.

I ended up building \`fantomely\` because I valued my time to be worth less than the ~$10/month that managed versions of Fathom, Plausible, and Fugu cost, and instead of self-hosting a third party (like Umami or Plausible), why not just self-host my own platform?

Currently, \`fantomely\` is in private beta, and powers the analytics on my [blog](https://antoniovdlc.me), but I might monetize it in the future. If you want to play around with it, feel free to [join the waitlist](https://fantomely.com/auth/waitlist), or look at the [source code](https://github.com/AntonioVdlC/fantomely).
